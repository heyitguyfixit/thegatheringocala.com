##About Us
(font:Antro Vectra,96px)"About Us"
Team image (Github-AMP)
(font:Moon Flower,48px)"What is the Gathering?"
(font:Josefin Sans,20px)"We're a community of Jesus-Followers (a.k.a. Christians) impassioned to see our community, "love God, Love People, No Matter What!" We love God no matter what: No matter what life throws our way, no matter how bad things seem to be, no matter how our human reasoning seems to spin things. We will honor God through living a life of worship to Him, exploding into an amazing time with God as we gather together.

We love people no matter what because God does. He loves us so much that even though we could be considered His enemy, He chose to take His judgment of our rebellion on Himself, through Lord Jesus on the cross. So we love like that by doing life together (fellowship) & teaching the Bible (Discipleship. What’s more, we will love in the most powerful way: sharing the message of salvation from our sin-debt through the sacrifice of Jesus Christ, throughout our community, Ocala.

We hope you'll come by and Gather with us soon!"

##Projects
(font:Antro Vectra,96px)"Projects"
(font:Josefin Sans,18px)"Below is a list of projects we are in need of partnerships:

    1) Our House (no, not anyone’s personal home):

This is our main place of gathering and launching out into the community around us. Located at 401 NW 3rd Ave, it is strategically situated to connect with many who are in need of a touch from our Lord Jesus.

    Our monthly rent: $1,750
    Average Utility Bill: $500-600
    Insurance: $?
    Repairs and Maintenance: Carpet or hard flooring, café tables and chairs, couches, gazeebo, paint, pallet wood, light fixtures or financial support to obtain such things

    2) Families in Need:

As we build upon the precepts to minister to the needs of “the least of these, thy brethren” we see how many people are in great need. So many ministries in Ocala minister to various needs. We want to join that army so that no one can slip through the cracks!

    Toiletries
    Clothing for babies, children, and adults
    Financial support to obtain such items

(font:Josefin Sans,18px)"Life Points are ministry efforts focused on shared interests. One of the most successful we’ve launched even before launching The Gathering, was our skateboard ministry known as Life Point (which is where we pulled the name). Each Life Point is a place where we seek to build relationships as Jesus often did, through finding a common ground that stirs a sense of community."

##What We Believe
(font:Antro Vectra,96px)"What We Believe"
(font:Josefin Sans,18px)"We believe the Bible to be the perfect words of our God, spoken through godly people, written to help us know our Creator’s heart for His people.
We believe that there is one God, revealed to us in God the Father (our creator), God the Son (our savior) and God the Holy Spirit (our energizer and so much more); all working together to save humanity from its own rebellion.
We believe what the Bible says about Jesus Christ (Y’shua): in His divinity, in His virgin birth, in His sinless life, in His miracles, in His atoning death through His shed blood on our behalf, in His bodily resurrection, in His ascension to the right hand of the Father, and in His personal return in power and glory.
We believe that for the salvation of lost and sinful man, the Holy Spirit must birth within us a new spirit, which is only possible because Jesus’ sacrifice that made us clean before God!
We believe in the ongoing work of the Holy Spirit by whose presence within the Christian, it is possible to journey with God!
We believe in the baptism of the Holy Spirit as a next step for the Christian life so that we can be strengthened to proclaim the salvation found only in Jesus to all who yet to believe!
We believe in the resurrection of the dead: That those who embraced salvation through Jesus would be resurrected to LIFE, and those who rejected Jesus’ salvation are resurrected to God’s judgment of DEATH! So let’s get the word out that there is a way out of that judgment of death!
We believe that Christians should strive to journey in unity with other Christians, united under the banner of Jesus our Lord and Savior!!!"
